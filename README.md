# Nuclear Navy

This repo compares the civilian nuclear fleet with the nuclear navy fleet. We demonstrate that the common conception that America stopped really building nuclear after the 1970's is not entirely accurate - the US Navy is actually a significant procurer and producer of nuclear reactors and represents an organization we can learn much from about how to safely build and deploy large amounts of nuclear power.
