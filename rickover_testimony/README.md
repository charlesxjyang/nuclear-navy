This is a cleaned up, machine-readable pdf of Admiral Hyman Rickover's testimony to Congress following the Three-Mile Island incident in 1979. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first machine-readable version produced.

It is based off of the transcript here: https://www.taproot.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/RickoverCongressionalTestimony.pdf
